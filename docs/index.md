## <img class="bitum-icon" alt="Bitum logo" src="/img/bitum-icons/BITUMsymbol.svg" /> What is Bitum?
Bitum is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency with a strong focus on community input, open governance, and sustainable funding for development. It utilizes a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mining system to ensure that a small group cannot dominate the flow of transactions or make changes to Bitum without the input of the community. A unit of the currency is called a bitum (BITUM).

## How Does it Work?
Stakeholders make and enforce the blockchain's consensus rules, set a course for future development, and decide how the project's treasury is used to fund it. Bitum's blockchain is similar to Bitcoin's, but with major aspects of [governance](governance/overview.md) baked into the protocol. 

To align incentives, block rewards are split between PoW miners, stakeholders and the Bitum Treasury, which funds the project. 

Subsidy | Party
---     | ---
60%   | PoW Miners
30%   | PoS Voters
10%   | Bitum Treasury

[Proof of Work](mining/overview.md) miners play a similar role for Bitum as they do for Bitcoin, but with Bitum they only receive 60% of the block reward.

[Proof of Stake](proof-of-stake/overview.md) voting is central to Bitum's governance. Bitum holders can time-lock (or "stake") BITUM to obtain voting tickets. Tickets are randomly called to vote on-chain; this involves both approving the work of PoW miners and voting Yes/No on any open [rule change proposals](governance/consensus-rule-voting/overview.md). 30% of the block reward goes to the holders of the tickets that voted in that block.

The remaining 10% of the block reward goes into the [Bitum Treasury](https://explorer.bitum.io/address/B1xAWYg2eAyXhbetkLTMWmWN3Ub8AZfkeTq). Holders of live tickets decide how that treasury is used through [Politeia proposals and voting](governance/politeia/overview.md).

The [Bitum Constitution](governance/bitum-constitution.md) sets out some guiding principles for the project; the constitution is subject to amendment through Politeia proposals.
