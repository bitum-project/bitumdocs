## Welcome To Bitum 

This guide offers signposts to some useful resources, including how to set up your Bitum wallet, buy BITUM, participate in Bitum’s governance, connect with the community and contribute to the project (contributors welcome!). 

## Wallets

[Bitum](../wallets/bitum/bitum-setup.md) is Bitum's GUI wallet. It supports Voting through [Voting Service Providers](https://bitum.io/vsp/) and offers the easiest way to start buying tickets and participating in governance.

There is also a [Command Line Interface](../wallets/cli/cli-installation.md) that exposes more advanced functionality, including the ability to run a personal Voting wallet.

### Contributing

Bitum is always looking for new contributors. A basic outline of how this works is: Show up, Find something useful to do, Do it, Get Paid. Do a small bit at first and see if other contributors in that domain appreciate it. This [recruitment page](https://bitum.io/recruiting/) explains the project's recruitment philosophy and approach in more detail.
