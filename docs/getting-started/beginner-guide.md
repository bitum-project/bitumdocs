## Welcome To Bitum 

This guide offers signposts to some useful resources, including how to set up your Bitum wallet, buy BITUM, participate in Bitumâ€™s governance, connect with the community and contribute to the project (contributors welcome!). 

## Wallets

### Contributing

Bitum is always looking for new contributors. A basic outline of how this works is: Show up, Find something useful to do, Do it, Get Paid. Do a small bit at first and see if other contributors in that domain appreciate it. This [recruitment page](https://www.bitum.io/recruiting/) explains the project's recruitment philosophy and approach in more detail.
