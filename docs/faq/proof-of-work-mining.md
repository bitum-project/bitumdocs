# :fa-fire: Proof-of-Work (PoW) Mining

---

#### 1. How long does it take for mined coins to get to my wallet? 

The coinbase maturity is 256 blocks[^16085]. That means the coins will not show up as spendable for that many blocks.

---

#### 2. How do I find out which block I mined? 

There will be an entry in the `bitumd` log[^16093] that looks something like:

```no-highlight
Accepted block 000... via getwork.
```
