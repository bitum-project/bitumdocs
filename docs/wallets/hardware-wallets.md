# <img class="bitum-icon" src="/img/bitum-icons/Wallet.svg" /> Hardware Wallets

A hardware wallet is a device that stores your private keys on a secure piece of hardware, instead
of in a file on your computer, as is done with [Bitum](../bitum/bitum-setup/) and other software wallets. Hardware wallets provide an additional level of security, and are generally considered more secure than software wallets.

Bitum is currently supported on two hardware wallets:

- [Trezor](https://trezor.io/)
- [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/)
